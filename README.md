    <h2>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine system disorder where small fluid-filled sacs develop on the ovaries.PCOS affects women in their reproductive years.
        It is also known as or Stein-Leventhal syndrome.</h2>
    <h3>
        WHAT IS PCOS? A number of small cysts, or fluid-filled sacs, on their ovaries. The cysts are not harmful, but they can lead to an imbalance in hormone levels.
        Women with PCOS may also experience menstrual cycle abnormalities, increased androgen (sex hormone) levels, excess hair growth, acne, and obesity.
        Women who can conceive with PCOS have a higher incidence of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, preeclampsia, and premature delivery.

    <h3>
        Symptoms include changes to the menstrual cycle and excess hair growth. Untreated, it can lead to infertility and other complications. The exact cause is unknown.
        Early diagnosis and treatment are recommended. Weight loss may also decrease the risk of associated health risks, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, and high blood pressure.

    <h4>Risk factors

        PCOS is thought to have a genetic component. People who have a mother or sister with PCOS are more likely to develop PCOS than someone whose relatives do not have the condition. This family link is the main risk factor.
        Sugar is the body’s primary source of energy, and it is regulated in the body by insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas. A person with insulin resistance is unable to use insulin efficiently. This causes the pancreas to go into overdrive secreting additional insulin to meet the body’s glucose needs.
        Excess insulin is thought to affect a woman’s ability to ovulate because of its effect on androgen production. Research has shown that women with PCOS have low-grade inflammation that stimulates polycystic ovaries to produce androgens.
        
     ASSOCIATED HEALTH RISKS
There are several health risks associated with PCOS.

These include:

type 2 diabetes
infertility
high cholesterol
elevated lipids
sleep apnea
liver disease
abnormal uterine bleeding
high blood pressure
obesity possibly leading to issues with low self-esteem and depression
metabolic syndrome
nonalcoholic fatty liver (steatohepatitis)
depression and anxiety

TESTS AND DIAGNOSIS
No single test can determine the presence of PCOS, but a doctor can diagnose the condition through medical history, a physical exam that includes a pelvic exam, and blood tests to measure hormone, cholesterol, and glucose levels.
